React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

@vitejs/plugin-react uses Babel for Fast Refresh
@vitejs/plugin-react-swc uses SWC for Fast Refresh
To run frontend:

run the following command using terminal
cd 'frontend/Fleet_project'
npm install yarn
yarn install
yarn dev
To run backend

run the following command using terminal
cd 'Backend'
npm install
npm install -g nodemon
npm run dev
